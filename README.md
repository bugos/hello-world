hello-world
===========

This repository is an idea taken from [Jessica Lord](https://github.com/jlord/hello-world).
<!-- Since she came up with something like this, she seems pretty cool! Εύγε Jessica! -->

It will contain a sundry of [coding-life](code-life.md) things. Mostly [resources](resources.md) which I want to keep, but also others to find and maybe [favorite](favorites.md) articles, blog posts, talks or any other dear thing!

**Open an issue if you've got a question or feedback!**
